Quick Notes Using Rofi

This script is meant to manage notes in a directory. A note is defined as any
file within the notes directory. Text files are preferred, but you can put any
file and qnr will be able to open it.

This is naive and simple by design, but I would like to implement a few
niceties.

# Dependencies

* rofi (pretty much any version)
* rifle (from ranger file manager--if not installed xdg-open will be used)

# Installation

For now, just put this script file in your favorite script directory. I create
a launcher in ~/bin for convenience
